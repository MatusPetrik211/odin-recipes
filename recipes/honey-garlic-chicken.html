    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken</li>
        <li>Honey</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Soy sauce</li>
        <li>Chicken broth</li>
        <li>Scallions</li>
        <li>Lemon juice</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Cornstarch</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 400F and move the rack to the top third of the oven.</li>
        <li>Add the sauce ingredients to a small bowl and whisk them together. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Cut the chicken breasts in half lengthwise so you have 4 thinner pieces. Season them with salt & pepper.</li>
        <li>Add the oil and butter to an oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Let the skillet heat up for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Cook the chicken for 4-5 minutes/side until golden.</li>
        <li>Give the sauce another quick whisk and then pour it into the skillet in between the chicken pieces. Let it bubble for 30 seconds, then take the pan off the heat. Quickly spoon some sauce over the chicken and then place the skillet in the oven for 4-5 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through (165F) and the sauce thickens up a little more. Do not cook much longer or the sauce will burn.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately (I spoon more sauce over top and add the chopped scallions).</li>
    </ol>
